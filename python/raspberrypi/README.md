# DFRobot_AI10
- [中文版](./README_CN.md)

This is a high-precision AI visual recognition module, featuring dual 2-megapixel cameras in combination with advanced deep learning algorithms. It is capable of accurately identifying both moving and static targets. Compared with traditional visual sensors, its anti-interference ability has been significantly enhanced and it is not affected by factors such as changes in environmental light, temperature fluctuations or complex backgrounds. Whether it is a fast-moving human body, a static human face or subtle palm vein features, the module can achieve rapid and stable detection and recognition.

## Summary

Provides an Arduino library that has the following features:
  Recognize human faces or palm prints
  Obtain the QR code information


## Installation
1. Download the library to Raspberry Pi first before use.

```
sudo git clone https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_AI10
```

1. Open and run the routine. To execute a routine demo_x.py, enter python demo_x.py in the command line. For example, to execute the routine continuous_recognition.py, you need to enter:

```
python  continuous_recognition.py
or
python2 continuous_recognition.py
or
python3 continuous_recognition.py
```
