# DFRobot_AI10
- [中文版](./README_CN.md)

This is a high-precision AI visual recognition module, featuring dual 2-megapixel cameras in combination with advanced deep learning algorithms. It is capable of accurately identifying both moving and static targets. Compared with traditional visual sensors, its anti-interference ability has been significantly enhanced and it is not affected by factors such as changes in environmental light, temperature fluctuations or complex backgrounds. Whether it is a fast-moving human body, a static human face or subtle palm vein features, the module can achieve rapid and stable detection and recognition.
